        <h2 class="cd_heading"> Story</h2>
        <p>There are two equaly improtant characters in the story- donut Dankey and coffe Cuppy. Dankey is a good looking guy who always has lots of people around him. He’s alsway in the center of attention. His nice outfits, sociability and very sarcastic sense of humour always bring him many people around. However, since he is very expressive guy, he is also known for being very impulsive and rather doing then thinking. </p>

        <p>Cuppy, on the other hand, is the nicest guy you could possibly meet. He trust people and believes in their truthfulness, what not once not twice brought him a lot of trouble. Normally he is quite boring, but has moments when he’s really playful and maybe even a little bit childish. And that was in the exact moment when he met Dankey. </p>

        <p>Having one of his moment of pure joy and happiness, coffee Cuppy came up to donut Dankey cause he really wanted to play with someone. However, he chose a bad very bad momet for Dankey, cause he was just taking his afternoon nap. Not thinking to much, Cuppy bowed down on his knees trying to reach Dankey with his hands. Dankey heard some noises around him so he slowly started to open his eyes not knowing what is happening aroud him. Before Cuppy realized, a big drop of coffee from the top of his cup dropped down straight on Dankey’s head. Donkey woke up suddenly with feeling of anger (what he was pretty sure about) he have never felt before. Blind for guilt written all over Cuppys face, not thinking too much, he opened his mouth and bite off a big piece from the bottom of Cuppy’s cup and stand still looking how the rest of the coffee is pouring out of the green Cuppy laying down on the ground.</p>
